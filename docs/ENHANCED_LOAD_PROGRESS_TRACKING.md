### 🕒 **Time Estimation and Performance Tracking**

#### Enhanced OverallProgress Class
```csharp
private class OverallProgress
{
    // Basic counters
    public int TotalManifests { get; set; }
    public int ProcessedManifests { get; set; }
    public int SuccessfulManifests { get; set; }
    public int FailedManifests { get; set; }
    
    // Timing and performance tracking
    public DateTime StartTime { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<TnoDataType, DateTime> TypeStartTimes { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<TnoDataType, TimeSpan> TypeDurations { get; set; }
    
    // Calculated properties
    public double CompletionPercentage { get; }
    public TimeSpan? EstimatedTimeRemaining { get; }
}
```

#### Features:
- **ETA Calculation**: Real-time estimated time remaining based on processing rate
