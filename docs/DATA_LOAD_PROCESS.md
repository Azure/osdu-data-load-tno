# Data Loading Process

This document explains the complete data loading process for the OSDU Data Load TNO application.

## Process Overview

The data loading process follows an orchestrated workflow that automatically loads all TNO data types in the correct dependency order. The process consists of 6 main steps:

### Step 1: Download TNO Dataset Files
- Downloads official TNO test data from GitLab repository (~2.2GB)
- Extracts and organizes files into expected directory structure

### Step 2: Create Legal Tag
- Establishes required legal compliance tags for data governance
- Sets up legal framework required by OSDU platform

### Step 3: Upload Files to OSDU (4-step process)
- **Step 3a**: Request file upload URL from File API
- **Step 3b**: Upload file content to storage location
- **Step 3c**: Submit metadata to File Service
- **Step 3d**: Maintain registry of uploaded files with IDs and versions

### Step 4: Generate Non-Work Product Manifests
- **Note**: The manifest generation is extremely complex - it was so complex that porting it to C# proved infeasible. Instead, the original [python scripts](../src/generate-manifest-scripts) are used but updated to upload the ACL, legal tag and data partition.
- Uses CSV templates to generate individual manifests for each data row
- Processes reference data, wells, wellbores, and related entities

### Step 5: Generate Work Product Manifests
- Iterates through uploaded files registry
- Retrieves JSON metadata from work product folders
- Updates manifests with legal tags, ACL permissions, and data partition IDs

### Step 6: Upload Manifests
- Submits all manifests to OSDU in correct dependency order:
  1. Reference Data (foundation lookup data)
  2. Misc Master Data (additional dependencies)
  3. Wells (well master data)
  4. Wellbores (depends on wells)
  5. Documents (document files)
  6. Well Logs (log files and data)
  7. Well Markers (geological markers)
  8. Wellbore Trajectories (directional surveys)
  9. Work Products (final metadata referencing uploaded files)
